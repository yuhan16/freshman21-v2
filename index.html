    Welcom! My name is Yuhan. I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu">New York University</a>, 
    majored in <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. 
    My current research focus are <em>game theory</em>, <em>cybersecurity</em> and <em>robotics</em>. You can find my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/CV-YuhanZhao.pdf">CV</a>.

  <p>
    <b>HuskyDev</b> is my personal blog, where I share my research projects and learning notes (mainly in Math and CS). 
    I also share some programming projects as personal interests.
  </p>
  
  
  During my PhD, I learned a lot of useful tools and knowledge. I believe that the mastery of everything comes from the basics. Besides, the fastest way to understand something is to teach people. Therefore, I decide to write down my own understandings towards the way in learning new things.
  First I think it is a good way to summarize what I have learned and form my own framework of knowledge. Second, it also helps me to remind the related knowledge especially the way of thinking by writting things down when I need them. 
  Thrid, I think by writting things down can help me organize myself and become more logical and make sure that I really understand it.
  
  It will be my great pleasure if you find some notes are helpful. By sharing the knowledge, you can gain more.
