    	Hello and Welcom! My name is Yuhan. I am a forth-year PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu">New York University</a>, 
    	majored in <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. 
    	My research interest centers around <b>game theory</b>,  <b>robotics</b>, and <b>control and optimization in multi-agent systems</b>.
  	</p>
  	
  	<p>
		I received my master's degree in <a ref="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">Robotics (GRASP lab)</a> at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University Pennsylvania</a> and my bachelor's in Automation at <a href="https://english.bit.edu.cn/">Beijing Institute of Techonology</a>.

    	<b>HuskyDev</b> is my blog, where I share my research projects and learning notes. During my PhD, I found a lot of valuable tools and knowledge that not only facilitated my research but also deepened my understanding of other related research fields.
		I believe that mastery of everything comes from the basics. Besides, the fastest way to understand something is to teach people. Therefore, I decide to write down my understanding of the way to learn new things.
  	</p>

	<p>
		It is beneficial to summarize what I have learned because it helps me build the knowledge framework, especially the way of thinking and learning. 
  		Also, I think writing things down can help me organize myself and become more logical and make sure that I understand them.
  		Finally, it is a great pleasure to share the knowledge and keep learning the unknown stuff.
