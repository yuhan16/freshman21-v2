Welcome! 

I have always been eager to build my personal blog from sketch. Now it comes true! 
<!--more-->

It is not as simple as I thought. So I thought it would be best to jot down what I learned along the way. Since I have zero background in web applications, some notes may be too obvious for an expert. Also, there are a lot of reserouces online, and I will refer to those that helped me along the way.

Also, I will write notes and blogs related to my research as a way to document and share ideas.
