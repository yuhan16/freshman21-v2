## Some notes

Make entire Div Clickable:
```html
<a href="http://example.com">
  <div class="example"> anything </div>
</a>
```
This is perfectly valid HTML.

In liquid, we can use composite filter. The exection order is from left to right. For example.
{%raw%}
```html
{% assign var = site.baseurl | append: "/page" | append: 2 | string %}
```
{%endraw%}
Note that `{ int | string }` convert integer to strings.


Also, we need to find a way to write liquid in code block.

## Publish github page with no jekyll
Github page only accepts specific jekyll plugins. Some plugins such as `jekyll-paginate-v2` cannot be recgnized by github pages. Therefore, one way to publish github page is to **publish the generated pages to Github** instead of letting github complie pages online. The generated pages are in `_site` folder.

We should note two things when using jekyll to generate pages and publish to github:
- in `_config.yaml`, set `baseurl: /your-repo-name`
- include an empty file named `.nojekyll` in the `_site` folder
- change `_site` to `docs`. Or move everything out of the `_site` folder.

### set `z-index` to overlay
The dropdown menu has `position: relative`. However, the two column layout also have the same property. Therefore, the two column layout may overlay the dropdown menu. To solve the problem, we have two ways:
- Set `position: static` to the two column layout. (May not feasible in some scenarios)
- Set `z-index` of the dropdown menu higher than the two column layout.

The superscript can be written like this<sup>[1]</sup> 

### font matter settings
Jekyll can distinguish plural. For example, 
```
category:
- ca
- cb
```
is equivalent to 
```
categories: ca cb
```
**Note:** there is no comma `,` when using the plural.

The same applies for `tag` and `tags`.

### link in markdown
Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

### For excerpt
We have two ways to display partial posts in the blog pages:
- use `excerpt` in the front matter
- use `excerpt_separator` in the front matter

For example, 
```yaml
excerpt: "These pre-written contents will be displayed in the blog page instead of any content in the post."
# or
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
```

The second methods displays the post content before `<!--more-->`.


### margin collaps
when we use `container-all` with 0 margin and 0 padding to cover the background, we may encounter a margin collapse. The container will automatically have margin. We can use a fack padding to solve this problem `padding: 0.1px`. 

See [Collapsing Margins of Block Elements](https://cmichel.io/css-margin-top-not-working)


### mathjax
in jekyll we can use mathjax to nicely display latex math formula. Here is how to use mathjax: [Use MathJax to write Equations in Jekyll blogs](http://zjuwhw.github.io/2017/06/04/MathJax.html)

Note that we need to add inline math `$ $` so that mathjax can recognize it. `$ $` is not recognized by default.

We can also change the math font size with `HTML-CSS` option: [Changing mathjax's font size](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19086152/changing-mathjaxs-font-size)

```html
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
      tex2jax: {
        inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']],
        processEscapes: true
      },
      "HTML-CSS": { scale: 90 }
    });
</script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
Note that we need `.` for different settings in `MathJax.Hub.Config`.


### github pages
In order to use the github page domain name `yuhan16.github.io`, we need to create a repo with the name `yuhan16.github.io`. Then we go to the GitHub page settings. The page will be automatically published to this domain.

See [About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)


### For testing
<i class="fa fa-car" style="font-size:48px;"></i>

{{page.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}

<a href="javascript:void(0)">testlink</a>

{{"Deep Learning" | remove: " " | downcase}}


### markup text in div and mathjax
<div> This is a paragraph without &lt p &gt.
This is a paragraph without &lt p &gt.
</div>

<div>
	<p>This is a paragraph without &lt;p&gt;.</p>
	<p>This is a paragraph without &lt;p&gt;.</p>
</div>

the mathjax may not always need \$\$ to display an equation. We can directly an equation environment.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	f(x) &= ax^2 + \log(x) \\ 
	g(x) &= kx+b
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Another example.
$$
\begin{split}
	f(x) &= ax^2 + \log(x) \\ 
	g(x) &= kx+b
\end{split}
$$
Therefore, the \$\$ is equivalent equation environment.

Let's see how \$\$ behaves in &lt;p&gt;

<p>
I have an equation here
$$
	f(x) = ax^2 + \log(x)
$$
and this is a line after the equation.
</p>

<p>
I have an equation here
\begin{equation}
	f(x) = ax^2 + \log(x)
\end{equation}
and this is a line after the equation.
</p>
Therefore, there is no need to add a blank line before and after \$\$ or equation environment.

```latex
\begin{equation}
	f(x) = ax^2 + \log(x)
\end{equation}
```
